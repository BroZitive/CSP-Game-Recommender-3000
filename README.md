# CSP-Game-Recommender-3000
A project I have created for my high school AP Computer Science class. This filters different video games based on their different qualities inputted by the user into the GUI and then returns the matching options into a GUI for the user to see. The program was designed in BlueJ IDE and so there are additional files that let the IDE work.
